# CALM-MIND-An-Interactive-Web-Application
This project, "CALM-MIND-An-Interactive Web Application" aims to develop a comprehensive platform that synergizes personalized yoga practice with an emotion-aware chatbot to promote holistic health. The system comprises two primary modules: Yoga and Chatbot.
The Yoga Module begins by assessing the user’s current emotional state through a selection of 19 predefined moods. Based on this input, the system recommends three tailored yoga poses from a dataset of 77 poses designed to address specific emotional needs. To ensure correct pose execution, the module employs advanced computer vision techniques, utilizing the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for accurate pose detection and PoseNet for extracting key joint features. An angle heuristic algorithm analyzes the user’s posture, providing real-time corrective feedback to enhance the effectiveness and safety of the practice.
Complementing the Yoga Module, the Chatbot Module engages users by recognizing and responding to 59 distinct emotions. Through an intuitive conversational flow, the chatbot inquires about the reasons behind the user’s emotions, offers empathetic support, and recommends relevant YouTube videos to aid in emotional regulation.
